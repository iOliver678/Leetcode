# Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1: Input: strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"], Output: [["ate","eat","tea"],["nat","tan"],["bat"]]

Example 2: Input: strs = [""], Output: []

1. make a dictionary
2. iterate through the array word by word
3. create a key from the sorted letters (sort the word, this is the key)
4. add the word to the dictionary with the key as the value
5. return the dictionary in the form of a list of lists

```py
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        anagrams = defaultdict(list)

        for word in strs :
            key = "".join(sorted(word))
```
