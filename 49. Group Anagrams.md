# Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1: Input: strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"], Output: [["ate","eat","tea"],["nat","tan"],["bat"]]

Example 2: Input: strs = [""], Output: []

1. Initialize a dictionary: Use a dictionary anagrams to store lists of words, with keys being tuples representing letter frequency.
2. Loop through each word: Iterate over every word in the input list.
3. Create a count list: For each word, initialize a list of size 26 (one element for each letter) with zeros.
4. Count the letters: For each character in the word, increment the corresponding index in the count list based on the characterâ€™s position in the alphabet.
5. Convert count list to a tuple: Change the count list to an immutable tuple to use it as a key.
6. Group words: Check if the tuple key exists in the dictionary. If it does, append the word to the existing list; if not, create a new entry.
7. Repeat for all words: Continue looping through the words to fill up the dictionary.
8. Return the grouped anagrams: Extract the lists of grouped words from the dictionary and return them as a list of lists.

```py
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        anagrams = defaultdict(list)

        for word in strs :
            count = [0] * 26

            for char in word:
                count[ord(char)- ord('a')]+=1

            anagrams[tuple(count)].append(word)
        return list(anagrams.values())
```
