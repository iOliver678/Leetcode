# Two Sum II

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1: Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [0,1]

Example 2: Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 Output: [1,2]

1. Create a hashmap to store the frequency of each number
2. Iterate through the array
3. Find the difference between the target and the current number
4. if the difference is in the hashmap, get the value using the number as the key
5. if not in the hashmap Add the current index to the list
6. check if the current index is less than the previous index
7. if so, return the previous index and the current index
8. if not, return the current index and the previous index
9. return the list

```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        m = {}
        for i in range(len(numbers)):
            curr_num = numbers[i]
            number_to_find = target - curr_num
            if number_to_find in m:
                index = m[number_to_find]
                if(i<index):
                    return[i+1,index+1]
                else:
                    return[index+1, i+1]
            else:
                m[curr_num] = i
```
