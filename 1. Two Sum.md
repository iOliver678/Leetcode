# Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1: Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [0,1]

Example 2: Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 Output: [1,2]

1. Create a hashmap
2. Iterate through the array
3. Find the difference between the current element and the target "number_to_find"
4. If the difference is in the hashmap, return the index of the current element
5. If the difference is not in the hashmap, add the current element to the hashmap with the index of the current element as the value.

```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        m = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            cur_num = nums[i] #2
            number_to_find = target-cur_num #7

            if number_to_find in m: #false
                index = m[number_to_find]
                return [i, index]
            else:
                m[cur_num] = i #{2:0}
```
