# Valid Parentheses

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Example 1: Input: "()" Output: true

Example 2: Input: "()[]{}" Output: true

Example 3: Input: "(]" Output: false

1. Create a stack
2. Create a mapping of the characters to their corresponding closing character
3. Iterate through the string
4. If the current character is an opening bracket, push it to the stack
5. If the current character is a closing bracket, pop the top element from the stack and check if it is the same as the current character also if the stack is empty, return false
6. return true if the stack is empty

```py
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        mapping = {")":"(","}":"{","]":"["}

        for char in s:
            if char in mapping.values():
                stack.append(char)
            elif char in mapping.keys():
                if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():
                    return False
        return not stack
```
