# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1: Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 5

Example 2: Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1] Output: 0

## Sliding Window

1. initialize a variable to hold the maximum profit, buy day, answer, and sell day
2. iterate through the array
3. Determine the maximum profit, sell day - buy day
4. If profit is negative, slide the window over
5. if profit is positive, get the max between answer and profit
6. return answer

```py
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = buy_day = sell_day = answer = 0

        for sell_day in range(len(prices)):
            profit = prices[sell_day] - prices[buy_day]
            if profit < 0 :
                buy_day = sell_day
                sell_day = 1
                continue
            else:
                answer = max(answer,profit)
        return answer
```
