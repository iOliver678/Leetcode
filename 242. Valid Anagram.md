# Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1: Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram" Output: true

Example 2: Input: s = "rat", t = "car" Output: false

O( n lg n) time complexity
Sort the strings and then compare them using two pointers

O(n) time complexity
Use a hashmap to store the frequency of each character in the string
then compare the maps

1. Create a hashmap for each string
2. Iterate through the string and increment the count of each character
3. Compare the maps and return true if they are equal

```py
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        countS, countT = {}, {}

        for char in s:
            countS[char] = countS.get(char,0) + 1

        for char in t:
            countT[char] = countT.get(char,0) + 1

        return countS == countT
```
