# Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example 1: Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4], Output: 6

Example 2: Input: nums = [1], Output: 1

1. Create a variable that holds the first element of the array
2. Create a variable that holds 0
3. Iterate through the array
4. If the total is less than 0, set the total to 0
5. Add the current element to the total
6. Set first varial to hold the max value of the total and the current element
7. Return the max value of the total and the current element

```py
class Solution:class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = nums[0]
        total = 0
        for n in nums:
            if total<0:
                total=0
            total+=n
            ans = max(ans, total)

        return ans
```
